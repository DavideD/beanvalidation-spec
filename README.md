# Bean Validation specification

This repository contains the Bean Validation specification. 
For more information on Bean Validation and the work in progress,
go to <http://beanvalidation.org>.


## Building docs

You need to have Apache Ant installed on your system and available in your classpath.

1. Run ant commands from the `specbook` directory
1. Running `ant` with no parameters will execute the default target which builds both PDF and HTML output in the `specbook/build/` directory.
1. Running `ant clean` will clean up output HTML and PDF files.


### Gotchas

1. Make sure your version control client does not trim empty directories.
