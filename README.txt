Building docs
-------------

You need to have Apache Ant installed on your system and available in your classpath.

1)  Run ant commands from this (docs) directory
2)  Running "ant" with no parameters will execute the default target which builds both PDF and HTML output in the build/ directory.
3)  Running "ant clean" will clean up output HTML and PDF files.



Gotchas
=======

1. Make sure your CVS client does not trim empty directories. CVS command line is ok.


DocBook Editors
===============

1. Use an XML editor
2. Use a DocBook WysiWig editor such as the free http://www.xmlmind.com/xmleditor/
